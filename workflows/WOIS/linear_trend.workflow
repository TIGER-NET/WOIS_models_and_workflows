.INSTRUCTIONS:Compile a monthly maximum NDVI time series from 10-day NDVI data.

SETTINGS

An image file located in the data directory:
Select one of the NDVI files in the folder you want to process.

Input images filename:
Retype the input image filename incl. file extension and by replacing the date string with Y,M,D (e.g., NDVI_20110523.tif becomes NDVI_YYYYMMDD.tif).

Output directory:
Define the path and folder where you want to save the processed data, e.g., C:\WOIS\PG03\MonthMax_NDVI

Output images filename:
Define an output filename using YMD for the date string position, e.g., MonthMax_NDVI_YMD.tif.

Aggregation condition:
year-month

Propagate NULLs:
If set to No, zero values won't be propagated.

Aggregate operation:
If set to maximum it will save the maximum value for each pixel.

Region extent:
Spatial subsetting of the image can be done by using Region extent. Leave it blank if you do not want to change the extent.

Other settings:
Leave the default values.

.INSTRUCTIONS:Spatial interpolation of missing data (for instance owing to cloud coverage).

SETTINGS

An image in the input directory:
Select a file from the directory where the monthly maximum NDVI images of step 1 were saved.

Method:
Choose the bilinear or bicubic interpolation method. Bilinear takes 4 (2x2) pixels and bicubic 16 (4x4) pixels into account. The result of the latter is smoother but also more time demanding.
(The Spline tension and smoothig parameters are not used with the bilinear or bicubic algorithm).

Output directory:
Define the path and folder where you want to save the processed data, e.g., C:\WOIS\PG03\MonthMax_NDVI\interpolated
If there are no missing data  in an NDVI image, it will not be processed. Therefore, it is recommended to overwrite the input files and leave the Region extent unchanged. Before you start processing, make a copy of your data.

Region extent:
Spatial subsetting of the image can be done by using Region extent. Leave it blank if you do not want to change the extent.

Other settings:
Leave the default values.

FURTHER INFORMATION

This step can take quite some processing time, all depending how large your data are.

If set to average, it will save the mean value for each pixel.

.INSTRUCTIONS:Calculation of linear slopes by regressing standardized NDVI anomalies (dependent variable) on time (independent variable).

Before continuing with the analysis, inspect the normalised NDVI images and define roughly the growth season. Usually, fresh green vegetation has high NDVI values, whereas dry land has values close to 0. In this step, use only NDVI data of the months within the growth season. This is in particular important for regions with very distinct dry and wet seasons.

Copy all the growth season NDVI images in a separate folder and use this folder for the following steps.

SETTINGS

An image file located in the data directory:
Select one of the normalized NDVI files in the folder with data of the growth season (see comments above).

Input images filename:
Retype the input image filename incl. file extension and by replacing the date string with Y,M,D (e.g., Norm_NDVI_201101.tif becomes Norm_NDVI_YYYYMM.tif).

Output directory:
Define the path and folder where you want to save the processed data, e.g., C:\WOIS\PG03\

Output images filename:
Define an output filename, e.g., slope.tif.
(there is no need to use YMD in the Output images filename, as there will be only one output file).

Aggregation condition:
Set to format (then the algorithm will take all images with the same format, such as .tif, into account).

Propagate NULLs:
No

Aggregate operation:
Set to slope, to calculate the slope of the trendline.

Other settings:
Leave the default values.
