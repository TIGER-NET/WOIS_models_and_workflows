Update NOAA-GFS climate forcing data.

SETTINGS

Select precipitation folder:
Choose the folder containing the NOAA-GFS precipitation product, e.g.: c:\WOIS\GFS_data\APCP

Select maximum temperature folder:
Choose the folder containing the NOAA-GFS daily maximum temperature product, e.g.: c:\WOIS\GFS_data\TMAX

Select minimum temperature folder:
Choose the folder containing the NOAA-GFS daily minimum temperature product, e.g.: c:\WOIS\GFS_data\TMIN

Other settings:
You can specify a geographic sub-area. If you leave the defaults (recommended), data for all of Africa will be downloaded.

FURTHER INFORMATION

The module connects to the internet and downloads the latest available precipitation and temperature data from http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/.
Daily precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature are computed and stored as geotiff files in the folders specified by the user. 
The user can change the default geographical area (which is set to include all of Africa) by changing the advanced parameters.

After running this module, the folders will contain forecasted climate forcing data to present plus 8 days and 1-day-ahead forecasts
for the historical period.

FURTHER INFORMATION

The module connects to the internet and downloads the latest available precipitation data from 
http://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews/africa/web/imgbrowsc2.php?extent=afp6. 
Daily precipitation is stored as geotiff files in the folder specified by the user. The user can adjust the period for which data should be downloaded.

After running this module, the precipitation folder will contain data for the requested period, unless the dataset in the online archive ends earlier.
Typically, FEWS-RFE is available with a real-time delay of a few days. No forecasted precipitation is available from FEWS-RFE.

.INSTRUCTIONS:
Update SWAT climate input files

SETTINGS

Model description file:
Choose the model description file created in step 2 of the model development workflow.

Precipitation folder:
Choose the directory containing the precipitation product, e.g.: C:\WOIS\GFS_data\APCP

Maximum temperature folder:
Choose the directory containing the daily maximum temperature product, e.g.: C:\WOIS\GFS_data\TMAX

Minimum temperature folder:
Choose the directory containing the daily minimum temperature product, e.g.: C:\WOIS\GFS_data\TMIN

Resolution of subcatchment map:
Keep at 0.01 degrees, unless you work with very small sub-basins.

FURTHER INFORMATION

This module computes zonal means of the climate forcing data for each subcatchment and stores the resulting time series in SWAT format.
The module requires a model description file as input. This file can be generated in step 2 of the MDWF.
The pixel resolution of the subcatchment map should be sufficient to resolve the smallest subcatchment in the model.

Create assimilation input files

SETTINGS

FURTHER INFORMATION

The WOIS assimilation module assimilates in-situ discharge observations and issues updated forecasts along with forecast uncertainties.
Runoff from each subcatchment is read from SWAT output files. A simple Muskingum routing model is established, based on available channel cross-sectional information. 
An autocorrelated lag-1 model is parameterised that represents the model error of the SWAT model. A Kalman filter routine is run to produce the best estimate of discharge in real time and forecast discharge 8 days ahead

Error parameterization

SETTINGS

Replace with global parameters:
If you choose 'Yes' the error parameters fitted in step 4.2 will be used for all reaches.
If you choose 'No' nothing will be done. In this case you have to manually edit the file 'Assimilation.txt' and specify individual error parameters for each reach.
