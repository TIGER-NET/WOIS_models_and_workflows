# WOIS_models_and_workflows
Collection of QGIS Processing models and workflows developed for WOIS

This collection of QGIS Processing Python and R models was developed as part of the Water Observation Information System (WOIS) under the TIGER-NET project funded by the European Space Agency as part of the long-term TIGER initiative aiming at promoting the use of Earth Observation (EO) for improved Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) in Africa.

The models are used in the WOIS workflows.
